### 🔹 For Linux Users (Ubuntu/Debian)

Open **Terminal** (you can search for it in your apps).

Type these commands one by one:

```bash
sudo apt update
```
👉 Press Enter, type your password if asked.

```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
```
👉 This installs Python and a tool called `pip`.

Check if it worked:
```bash
python3 --version
```
👉 You should see something like `Python 3.8` or higher.

✅ Python is now installed!

---

## 🔧 Step 2: Install `pip` (Only for Windows & Mac – Usually Already Exists)

`pip` is a tool that helps install libraries like Streamlit.

### 🔹 Check if `pip` is already installed

Open **Command Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac/Linux) and type:

```bash
pip --version
```

👉 If you see a version (like `pip 23.0`), great! You’re done.

👉 If you see **"command not found"**, run this:

### For Windows/Mac:
Download from: [https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)  
Save the file as `get-pip.py`

Then in Command Prompt/Terminal, go to the folder where you saved it and run:

```bash
python get-pip.py
```

✅ Now `pip` is installed.

---

## 🌐 Step 3: Install Streamlit

Now we install Streamlit using `pip`.

In **Command Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac/Linux), type:

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

Wait for it to finish. You’ll see lines like:

```
Downloading streamlit...
Installing collected packages: streamlit
Successfully installed streamlit-1.29.0
```

✅ Streamlit is now installed!

---

## 🧪 Step 4: Test Streamlit (Build Your First App!)

Let’s make a simple app to check if everything works.

### Step 4.1: Create a New File

1. Open **Notepad** (Windows) or **TextEdit** (Mac)
2. Type this code:
```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("My First App")
st.write("Hello! This is my first Streamlit app.")
```

3. Save the file as: `my_app.py`  
   - Save it on your Desktop
   - Make sure it ends with `.py` (not `.txt`)

> 💡 On Mac: In TextEdit, go to Format → Make Plain Text before saving.

---

### Step 4.2: Run the App

Open **Command Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac/Linux).

Type:
```bash
cd Desktop
```
👉 This tells the computer: “Go to the Desktop”.

Then run:
```bash
streamlit run my_app.py
```

Wait a few seconds.

👉 A web browser will open automatically at `http://localhost:8501`

You should see:
- A title: "My First App"
- A message: "Hello! This is my first Streamlit app."

✅ Congratulations! You just built and ran your first web app!

> 🔁 To stop the app, go back to Command Prompt/Terminal and press `Ctrl + C`

### ✅ Step 1: Create the File

Create a new file called `12_session.py`

👉 Copy and paste this code:

```python
import streamlit as st

# Initialize counter if not exists
if "counter" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.counter = 0

# Show current count
st.write(f"Counter: {st.session_state.counter}")

# Buttons to change counter
if st.button("Add 1"):
    st.session_state.counter += 1

if st.button("Reset"):
    st.session_state.counter = 0

# Bonus: Use widget with key
name = st.text_input("Save your name", key="user_name")
if st.session_state.user_name:
    st.write(f"Hello again, {st.session_state.user_name}!")
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Run the App

Run this command:
```bash
streamlit run 12_session.py
```

✅ You should see:
- A counter that increases when you click "Add 1"
- It **remembers the count** even after clicking other buttons
- A text box that remembers your name

> 💡 Without `st.session_state`, Streamlit forgets everything on every click.

## 📘 Lecture 13: Caching (Speed Up Your App)

### 🎯 What You’ll Learn
- Make your app faster
- Use `@st.cache_resource` and `@st.cache_data`

---

### ✅ Step 1: Create the File

Create a new file called `13_caching.py`

👉 Copy and paste this code:

```python
import streamlit as st
import time
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# ❌ Slow function (without cache)
def slow_function():
    st.write("⏳ Loading data... (This takes time!)")
    time.sleep(3)
    return pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(10, 2), columns=["A", "B"])

# ✅ Fast function (with cache)
@st.cache_data
def cached_function():
    st.write("📦 Caching data...")
    time.sleep(3)
    return pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(10, 2), columns=["A", "B"])

st.subheader("Without Cache")
if st.button("Run Slow Function"):
    result = slow_function()
    st.dataframe(result)

st.subheader("With Cache")
if st.button("Run Cached Function"):
    result = cached_function()
    st.dataframe(result)
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Run the App

Run this command:
```bash
streamlit run 13_caching.py
```

✅ Try:
1. Click **"Run Slow Function"** → waits 3 seconds
2. Click again → waits again
3. Click **"Run Cached Function"** → waits 3 seconds
4. Click again → **instant result!**

> 💡 `@st.cache_data` saves the result so it doesn’t run again.

---

## 🧠 Bonus: When to Use Caching?

| Use Case | Which Decorator |
|--------|----------------|
| Load a big CSV file | `@st.cache_data` |
| Load a machine learning model | `@st.cache_resource` |
| Process data (e.g., clean CSV) | `@st.cache_data` |
| Connect to database | `@st.cache_resource` |

> 🔹 `@st.cache_data` → for data (CSV, lists, DataFrames)  
> 🔹 `@st.cache_resource` → for heavy objects (models, connections)

---

## 📦 Summary: All 13 Lectures Done!

# 🚶‍♂️ Next Topic: **How to Debug Common Streamlit Errors**  

> 🎯 You’ve built apps. Now let’s **fix common mistakes** — the right way.  
> No panic. No confusion. Just simple fixes.  
> Perfect for beginners who see errors and think: “What now?”

---

## 🛠️ Why This Matters

Even expert coders make mistakes.  
The key is not to **avoid errors**, but to **understand and fix them fast**.

In this guide, you’ll learn:
- How to read error messages
- Fix 7 most common Streamlit errors
- Use tools to prevent bugs
- Keep your app running smoothly

✅ All examples are **copy-paste friendly**.

---

## 🧰 Rule #1: Always Look at the Red Text

When your app crashes, Streamlit shows **red error messages** in the browser and terminal.

👉 **Read the last few lines** — that’s where the real problem is.

---

## ❌ Error 1: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'streamlit'`

### 📌 Cause
Streamlit is not installed.

### 💡 Fix
Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install streamlit
```

✅ Wait for it to say "Successfully installed".

Then run your app again:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

> 🔁 If you get `pip: command not found`, try `pip3 install streamlit`

---

## ❌ Error 2: `File "app.py", line 5, NameError: name 'st' is not defined`

### 📌 Cause
You forgot to import Streamlit.

### 💡 Fix
Add this line at the top of your file:
```python
import streamlit as st
```

👉 **Wrong code:**
```python
st.write("Hello")  # ❌ No import!
```

👉 **Correct code:**
```python
import streamlit as st  # ✅ Add this!
st.write("Hello")
```

✅ Always start your file with:
```python
import streamlit as st
```

---

## ❌ Error 3: `File not found: 'profile.jpg'`

### 📌 Cause
The file is missing or in the wrong folder.

### 💡 Fix
Make sure:
1. The file exists (`profile.jpg`)
2. It’s in the **same folder** as your `.py` file

👉 Example folder:
```
my_app/
├── app.py
├── profile.jpg   ← must be here!
```

Or use the correct path:
```python
st.image("images/profile.jpg")  # if inside images/ folder
```

✅ Tip: Right-click the file → "Copy path" to check.

---

## ❌ Error 4: `st.button() did not work after input`

### 📌 Cause
Streamlit **reruns the whole script** every time you click or type.

So if you type something, the button resets.

### 💡 Fix
Use `st.session_state` to remember values.

👉 **Wrong code:**
```python
clicked = st.button("Click me")
if clicked:
    st.write("Button was clicked!")
# But it resets when you type in a text box
```

👉 **Correct code:**
```python
import streamlit as st

if "clicked" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.clicked = False

if st.button("Click me"):
    st.session_state.clicked = True

if st.session_state.clicked:
    st.success("Button was clicked and remembered!")
```

✅ Now the click is **remembered** even after typing.

---

## ❌ Error 5: `st.pyplot() deprecated warning`

### 📌 Cause
Old way of showing Matplotlib plots.

### 💡 Fix
Use `st.pyplot(fig)` with `fig` argument.

👉 **Wrong code:**
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1, 2, 3])
st.pyplot()  # ❌ Warning!
```

👉 **Correct code:**
```python
import streamlit as st
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot([1, 2, 3])
st.pyplot(fig)  # ✅ Correct!
```

✅ Always pass `fig` to `st.pyplot()`.

---

## ❌ Error 6: `text_input()` doesn’t keep value

### 📌 Cause
Streamlit forgets input after every interaction.

### 💡 Fix
Use `key` to save input in `st.session_state`.

👉 **Wrong code:**
```python
name = st.text_input("Name")
st.write(f"Hello {name}")  # Becomes empty when you do other actions
```

👉 **Correct code:**
```python
name = st.text_input("Name", key="user_name")
if st.session_state.user_name:
    st.write(f"Hello, {st.session_state.user_name}!")
```

✅ The `key` links the input to session state.

---

## ❌ Error 7: App runs but nothing shows

### 📌 Cause
No `st.write()` or display command.

### 💡 Fix
Add output commands.

👉 **Wrong code:**
```python
import streamlit as st
x = 10
y = 20
z = x + y  # No output shown
```

👉 **Correct code:**
```python
import streamlit as st
x = 10
y = 20
z = x + y
st.write(f"Result: {z}")  # ✅ Now it shows
```

✅ Streamlit only shows what you tell it to show.

## 🧪 Practice: Debug This Broken App

Let’s fix a real broken app together.

### ✅ Step 1: Create `broken_app.py`

👉 Copy and paste this **broken** code:

```python
# This app has 4 errors. Can you fix them?

# 1. Missing import
# 2. File not found
# 3. Button not working
# 4. No output shown

name = st.text_input("Enter your name")

if st.button("Greet Me"):
    st.write("Hello " + name)

st.image("my_photo.jpg")  # photo doesn't exist
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Run It

Run:
```bash
streamlit run broken_app.py
```

👉 You’ll see errors.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Fix It (Correct Code)

Create a new file: `fixed_app.py`

👉 Copy and paste this **fixed** version:

```python
import streamlit as st  # ✅ Fixed: Added import

# ✅ Fixed: Initialize session state
if "greeted" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.greeted = False

name = st.text_input("Enter your name", key="user_name")  # ✅ Saved in session

if st.button("Greet Me"):
    st.session_state.greeted = True

# ✅ Fixed: Show output only if name exists
if st.session_state.greeted and st.session_state.user_name:
    st.success(f"Hello, {st.session_state.user_name}! 👋")

# ✅ Fixed: Use a working image (or comment out)
# st.image("my_photo.jpg")  # Removed or replace with valid file
st.write("🖼️ No image for now — but app works!")
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Run the Fixed App

Run:
```bash
streamlit run fixed_app.py
```

✅ Now it works!

## 🧰 Pro Tips to Avoid Bugs

| Tip | How |
|-----|-----|
| ✅ Always start with `import streamlit as st` | First line of every file |
| ✅ Use `key` for inputs | `st.text_input("Name", key="name")` |
| ✅ Test one feature at a time | Don’t write 100 lines at once |
| ✅ Use `st.write()` to debug | Print values to see what’s happening |
| ✅ Save files in the same folder | No broken image/audio errors |

---

## 🚨 When in Doubt: Restart!

If your app acts weird:
1. Press `Ctrl + C` in terminal
2. Close browser tab
3. Run again:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

✅ Fresh start fixes many issues.
