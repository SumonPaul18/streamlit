### 🔹 For Linux Users (Ubuntu/Debian)

Open **Terminal** (you can search for it in your apps).

Type these commands one by one:

```bash
sudo apt update
```
👉 Press Enter, type your password if asked.

```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
```
👉 This installs Python and a tool called `pip`.

Check if it worked:
```bash
python3 --version
```
👉 You should see something like `Python 3.8` or higher.

✅ Python is now installed!

---

## 🔧 Step 2: Install `pip` (Only for Windows & Mac – Usually Already Exists)

`pip` is a tool that helps install libraries like Streamlit.

### 🔹 Check if `pip` is already installed

Open **Command Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac/Linux) and type:

```bash
pip --version
```

👉 If you see a version (like `pip 23.0`), great! You’re done.

👉 If you see **"command not found"**, run this:

### For Windows/Mac:
Download from: [https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)  
Save the file as `get-pip.py`

Then in Command Prompt/Terminal, go to the folder where you saved it and run:

```bash
python get-pip.py
```

✅ Now `pip` is installed.

---

## 🌐 Step 3: Install Streamlit

Now we install Streamlit using `pip`.

In **Command Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac/Linux), type:

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

Wait for it to finish. You’ll see lines like:

```
Downloading streamlit...
Installing collected packages: streamlit
Successfully installed streamlit-1.29.0
```

✅ Streamlit is now installed!

---

## 🧪 Step 4: Test Streamlit (Build Your First App!)

Let’s make a simple app to check if everything works.

### Step 4.1: Create a New File

1. Open **Notepad** (Windows) or **TextEdit** (Mac)
2. Type this code:
```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("My First App")
st.write("Hello! This is my first Streamlit app.")
```

3. Save the file as: `my_app.py`  
   - Save it on your Desktop
   - Make sure it ends with `.py` (not `.txt`)

> 💡 On Mac: In TextEdit, go to Format → Make Plain Text before saving.

---

### Step 4.2: Run the App

Open **Command Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac/Linux).

Type:
```bash
cd Desktop
```
👉 This tells the computer: “Go to the Desktop”.

Then run:
```bash
streamlit run my_app.py
```

Wait a few seconds.

👉 A web browser will open automatically at `http://localhost:8501`

You should see:
- A title: "My First App"
- A message: "Hello! This is my first Streamlit app."

✅ Congratulations! You just built and ran your first web app!

> 🔁 To stop the app, go back to Command Prompt/Terminal and press `Ctrl + C`

- Use `st.session_state`

---

### ✅ Step 1: Create the File

Create a new file called `12_session.py`

👉 Copy and paste this code:

```python
import streamlit as st

# Initialize counter if not exists
if "counter" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.counter = 0

# Show current count
st.write(f"Counter: {st.session_state.counter}")

# Buttons to change counter
if st.button("Add 1"):
    st.session_state.counter += 1

if st.button("Reset"):
    st.session_state.counter = 0

# Bonus: Use widget with key
name = st.text_input("Save your name", key="user_name")
if st.session_state.user_name:
    st.write(f"Hello again, {st.session_state.user_name}!")
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Run the App

Run this command:
```bash
streamlit run 12_session.py
```

✅ You should see:
- A counter that increases when you click "Add 1"
- It **remembers the count** even after clicking other buttons
- A text box that remembers your name

> 💡 Without `st.session_state`, Streamlit forgets everything on every click.

## 📘 Lecture 13: Caching (Speed Up Your App)

### 🎯 What You’ll Learn
- Make your app faster
- Use `@st.cache_resource` and `@st.cache_data`

---

### ✅ Step 1: Create the File

Create a new file called `13_caching.py`

👉 Copy and paste this code:

```python
import streamlit as st
import time
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# ❌ Slow function (without cache)
def slow_function():
    st.write("⏳ Loading data... (This takes time!)")
    time.sleep(3)
    return pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(10, 2), columns=["A", "B"])

# ✅ Fast function (with cache)
@st.cache_data
def cached_function():
    st.write("📦 Caching data...")
    time.sleep(3)
    return pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(10, 2), columns=["A", "B"])

st.subheader("Without Cache")
if st.button("Run Slow Function"):
    result = slow_function()
    st.dataframe(result)

st.subheader("With Cache")
if st.button("Run Cached Function"):
    result = cached_function()
    st.dataframe(result)
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Run the App

Run this command:
```bash
streamlit run 13_caching.py
```

✅ Try:
1. Click **"Run Slow Function"** → waits 3 seconds
2. Click again → waits again
3. Click **"Run Cached Function"** → waits 3 seconds
4. Click again → **instant result!**

> 💡 `@st.cache_data` saves the result so it doesn’t run again.

---

## 🧠 Bonus: When to Use Caching?

| Use Case | Which Decorator |
|--------|----------------|
| Load a big CSV file | `@st.cache_data` |
| Load a machine learning model | `@st.cache_resource` |
| Process data (e.g., clean CSV) | `@st.cache_data` |
| Connect to database | `@st.cache_resource` |

> 🔹 `@st.cache_data` → for data (CSV, lists, DataFrames)  
> 🔹 `@st.cache_resource` → for heavy objects (models, connections)

## 🚀 Mini Project: Build a BMI Calculator

Let’s combine what you’ve learned!

Create a file: `bmi_calculator.py`

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("🧮 BMI Calculator")

# Input
height = st.slider("Height (cm)", 100, 250, 170)
weight = st.slider("Weight (kg)", 30, 200, 70)

# Calculate
bmi = weight / ((height / 100) ** 2)

# Show result
st.subheader(f"Your BMI: {bmi:.2f}")

# Give feedback
if bmi < 18.5:
    st.warning("Underweight")
elif bmi < 25:
    st.success("Normal weight")
elif bmi < 30:
    st.warning("Overweight")
else:
    st.error("Obese")
```

Run it:
```bash
streamlit run bmi_calculator.py
```

✅ You just built a real tool!
